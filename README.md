# Flow ID Wireshark Plugin

This repository contains two complementary pieces for experimenting with flow
identifiers that originate from UDP metadata packets and need to be applied to
both UDP and TCP conversations in Wireshark:

* `wireshark/flow_id.lua` – a Lua post-dissector that discovers flow metadata
  and exposes it as a custom field (`flowid.id`). When the field is turned into
  a column, every packet that participates in the annotated sessions shows the
  matching flow identifier.
* `scripts/generate_sample_pcap.py` – a helper script that creates a PCAP file
  with UDP metadata packets and matching TCP conversations so the dissector can
  be tested without additional tooling.

## Wireshark plugin

1. Copy `wireshark/flow_id.lua` into your local Wireshark plugins directory
   (e.g. `~/.local/lib/wireshark/plugins/` on Linux or
   `%APPDATA%\Wireshark\plugins` on Windows).
2. Restart Wireshark. The dissector registers a new protocol named
   **Flow ID Tracker** with the custom field `flowid.id`.
3. Open a capture that contains the metadata packets. In the *Packet Details*
   pane expand **Flow ID Tracker → Flow ID**, right-click the `Flow ID` field,
   and choose **Apply as Column**. Alternatively, add a new custom column in
   *Preferences → Appearance → Columns* that references the `flowid.id` field.
   Wireshark will now display the identifier for every packet that belongs to
   the associated UDP or TCP sessions.
4. For convenience the plugin also appends the flow identifier to the *Info*
   column whenever a dedicated column is not configured.

The dissector expects metadata packets to contain ASCII payload similar to:

```
flow_id=<uuid>;tcp_port=<port>
```

Only `flow_id` is strictly required. When `tcp_port` is present, the plugin
propagates the identifier to the TCP stream that uses that port even if the
metadata packet appears after the first TCP segments. Additional key/value
pairs are ignored.

## Sample capture generator

The generator is implemented with only Python's standard library, so no extra
dependencies are required. Create a sample capture file by running:

```
python scripts/generate_sample_pcap.py
```

A file named `sample_flows.pcap` will be written to the current working
directory. The script prints the UUIDs that were embedded in the metadata
packets so you can verify them inside Wireshark. Pass a different path as an
argument to store the capture elsewhere.

The generated capture exercises several edge cases:

* A canonical flow where UDP metadata precedes the rest of the traffic.
* A TCP conversation that begins before its metadata is emitted and still picks
  up the announced identifier once the metadata packet appears later in the
  trace.
* A UDP-only flow whose metadata arrives mid-conversation and does not specify
  a TCP port.
* Additional TCP and UDP noise without any metadata to confirm the dissector
  leaves unrelated packets untouched.

## Testing the plugin headlessly

`tshark` can be used to verify the plugin without the graphical interface. For
example:

```
tshark -r sample_flows.pcap -X lua_script:wireshark/flow_id.lua -T fields -e flowid.id | sort | uniq -c
```

The output should include the UUID generated by the script and an empty line
for packets that do not belong to a tagged flow.
